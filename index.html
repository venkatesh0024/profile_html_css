                    <p>I an a passionate Engineer with a degree in Information Technology Engineering. My very first experience with code was at the time when I started my own blog. My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS.Sooner, the excitment of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing and that's when I decided to purse Web development.</p>
                    <p>Recently, I learnt Full Stack Development. I have knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures. Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.</p>
                    <p>I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build products that make a difference.</p>
